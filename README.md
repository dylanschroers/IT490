# IT490

This repo is a partial project I worked on during my senior year at NJIT, due to various reasons the group was redistributed to other groups. This repo showcases my contributions before then.

The project consisted of a simple web server hosted through apache connected to a remote db server which cached information from an API to display to the website. My contributions included designing and implementing of the database schema as well as retrieving and caching the information from the API into said database.

The project consisted of various virtual machines running Ubuntu operating system connected on a virtual LAN using ZeroTier using RabbitMQ payloads for inter-device communication.
